# Hey there! I'm Sugavanesh Murugesan 👋

## About Me

Code, automation, and scaling up—welcome to my world! I'm a **DevOps Engineer** in action, but my roots run deep in backend development and open-source contributions. Whether I’m automating infrastructure or building robust systems, you’ll always catch me crafting something cool. From wild Go experiments to building entire projects with .NET and React, my GitHub is where the magic unfolds.

I’m constantly exploring the connections between **programming, science, and nature** 🌱—taking cues from nature’s efficiency to build better systems. Oh, and my love for personal dev environments (PDEs) remains strong; think **high-speed typing** and **tiling window managers** for ultra-slick productivity!

## Tech Stack ⚡
