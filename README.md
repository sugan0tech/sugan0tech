## About Me

I'm a backend developer obsessed with **scale**, **systems**, and **structure**.

- Always hacking on backend stacks — from **Java**, **Go**, **C#**, to **Python**
- Learning what different ecosystems teach — and applying their **secret sauce** across stacks
- Deep interest in **networking**, **databases**, **Kubernetes**, and **infrastructure**
- Fluent in **Ansible**, **PowerShell**, **Bash**, and everything automation
- Building my own computing philosophy via [dotfiles](https://github.com/sugan0tech/dotfiles), [nvim config](https://github.com/sugan0tech/nvim), and [TmuxCraft](https://github.com/sugan0tech/tmuxcraft)

> _The tools you use define how you think. I build mine with purpose._

```

I'm not chasing hype.
I'm chasing how systems work and how far I can push them.
